# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview
Anticipating that a number of Pewlett-Hackard employees will soon be reaching retirement age, this analysis breaks down current employees born between 1952-1955 by current job title in order to view how many positions at different levels will be left vacant and need to be filled. In order to address these voids, eligibility for a mentorship program (for employees born in 1965 to help train new hirees before retiring completely) was compiled. 

## Results
Provide a bulleted list with four major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* A total of 72,458 employees are expected to retire.
* 70% of the exiting employees are in positions of high-level leadership (roughly 35% of the Senior Engineers and 35% of the Senior Staff).

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight
