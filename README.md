# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview

Anticipating that a number of Pewlett-Hackard employees will soon be reaching retirement age, this analysis breaks down current employees born between 1952-1955 by current job title in order to view how many positions at different levels will be left vacant and need to be filled. In order to address these voids, eligibility for a mentorship program (for employees born in 1965 to help train new hirees before retiring completely) was compiled. 

## Results

* A total of 72,458 employees are expected to retire.
* 70% of the exiting employees are in positions of high-level leadership (roughly 35% of the Senior Engineers and 35% of the Senior Staff).
* 16,921 of the employees who would be eligile for promotion to those positions are also set to retire.

* 1,549 employees will be retiring in the 10 years following and are eligible to become mentors to new employees before doing so.

## Summary

There are currently 300,024 employees at Pewlett-Hackard, which means that 1/4 of the entire work force will be retiring soon (the majority of whom are in leadership positions).

There are 1,549 employees under the current criteria who are eligible for the mentorship program, should they wish to join. This is not anywhere near enough people to train current and new hires to move up the ladder to fill those vacated positions quickly. Expanding the eligibility criteria to those retiring imminently would make a significant impact.

Evaluating how many people have been in leadership roles long enough to provide mentoring (regardless of when they were born) could also significantly increase the number of mentors (as it's not necessarily how old an employee is that qualifies them to provide training and insight, but how experienced they are in that role). 

Additionally, looking at how many employees there are at lower levels would help inform hiring decisions (e.g., if the current Engineers were promoted to Senior Engineers in order to fill those voids, would there be enough employees to take THEIR place? Does Pewlett-Hackard need to look into hiring already established workers, or will focusing on hiring entry-level positions feed enough employees into the pipeline to avoid future gaps when employees retire?).
