# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Project Overview

Anticipating that a number of Pewlett-Hackard employees will soon be reaching retirement age, this analysis breaks down current employees born between 1952-1955 by current job title in order to view how many positions at different levels will be left vacant and need to be filled. In order to address these voids, eligibility for a mentorship program (for employees born in 1965 to help train new hirees before retiring completely) was compiled. 

## Results

* A total of 72,458 employees are expected to retire.
* 70% of the exiting employees are in positions of high-level leadership (roughly 35% of the Senior Engineers and 35% of the Senior Staff).

* 1,549 employees will be retiring in the 10 years following and are eligible to become mentors to new employees before doing so.
* Implementing the mentorship program as soon as possible (and perhaps extending the criteria to allow some of the employees set to retire imminently the option to stay on in a part-time mentorship role) will provide the opportunity to pass on knowledge to new hires as well as current employees, so that they are set to take on the vacated leadership roles as quickly as possible. 

## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?
Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?

The summary addresses the two questions and contains two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight
